## Research

Our current research focuses on studying the biology and control of exotic and reemerging Phytophthora diseases with a particular emphasis on the Sudden Oak Death pathogen, *P. ramorum* and the Irish famine pathogen *P. infestans*. We are particularly interested in understanding how pathogens evolve and adapt and development of related computational tools.
