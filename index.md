Welcome to the Gr√ºnwald lab in Corvallis. We combine basic tools from genomics, epidemiology and bioinformatics, with translational research approaches to strategically address some of the fundamental challenges posed by plant diseases caused by the genus *Phytophthora*.

Specifically, our team is interested in the epidemiology, genetics and evolution of exotic and reemerging *Phytophthora* species. The genus *Phytophthora* contains most destructive plant pathogens affecting agricultural and forest crops. Important examples include *P. ramorum*, a devastating exotic pathogen causing sudden oak death, and *P. infestans*, known as the cause of the Irish potato famine. Much of our work is conducted with a focus on translational applications towards improving disease management in agriculture.
